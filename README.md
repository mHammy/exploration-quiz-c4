# Exploration-Quiz

## Description

- My motivation for this application was to code a functioning quiz to test javascript knowledge with 10 questions.
- I wanted to make sure the score felt impactful on each attempt, so you could compare your previous scores.
- This application is a testament of how far I've come already in my ability to code javascript.
